    Bootstrap: 
    A CSS framework that provides pre-styled components and layouts to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface. It simplifies the process of designing and styling the application.

     Axios: 
    A popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from the browser. In this case, Axios is used to fetch data from the server to populate the user's payment history and other related information.

    jwt:
